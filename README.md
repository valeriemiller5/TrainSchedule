# TrainSchedule
This project shows an imaginary train schedule that will calculate what time the next train will arrive at the station and how much time (in minutes) from the current time will pass before the next train arrives.  Users may also add their own train to the schedule that will remain, even when the user logs out of the browser.

## Getting Started
